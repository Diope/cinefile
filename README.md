Just forcing myself to code as I haven't been focused and intentional with it, been suffering from "oooo shiny" syndrome trying to learn every IaC tool known to man, more DevOps stuff (the amount of time I've spent reading through Jenkins and Prometheus' documentation is ridiculous).

This is a bit more simple and straightforward. Just consumption of TMDB API, presented in a nice way via React. Using CircleCI for CI/CD in lieu of Github Workflow just because, and hosting this on AWS. Still debating on attempting Terraform shenanegians, but the day is young.
